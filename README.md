# Super-Tank-Melee-reloaded-
Super Tank Melee (reloaded) is a turn-based tactical top-down tank shooter. I've been playing a lot of C64 games as a child, hence this game is meant as an hommage to all the great titles that came out during that era.

# About the game
The game mechanics are quite simple. You can move your tank with the arrows keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) and fire your gun (Space) in the direction you are facing. As this is a turn based came, you have to plan your movement carefully to prevent running out of Tokens - or you'll be a sitting duck and easily get toasted by your enemies.

# Environment
The environment you are moving on affects you abilities to maneuver; e.g. water is slowing you down, certain objects can block your path (and provide cover to enemy fire as well), certain objects can be destroyed to make way, certain areas might even dangerous for you as booby traps are waiting for you. You can also find secret areas with power-ups or other boosters for your tank.

# Graphics
The black & white, 8-Bit stylish graphics are meant to be simple and understandable for every player. They're also meant as an hommage to old C4 titles (that surely had more color in them, haha - but think of playing this game on a B/W TV). I'm planning a more colorful version for the future, when this version is done and playable.

# Tokens
Tokens decide what you are able to do while it is your turn. You can move, shoot, lay traps, or else, but each action costs you a different amount of tokens; so plan strategically or you gonna end up on the disadvantage. Each round starts with a predefined number of tokens, but you can increase or decrease this number by certain items or achievements you did in the last round.

This is my first game project using Javascript, CSS and HTML. I've been making banner ads for a living, so I've decided to gathermore experience with trying out new techniques such as working / manipulation image maps, canvas, eg. All game designs (sprites, menues, etc.) are made by me.
